# YouTube Data Harvesting Warehousing


# Overview

      This project is focused on harvesting data from YouTube channels using the YouTube API, processing the data, and warehousing it. The harvested data is initially stored in a MongoDB Atlas database as documents and is then converted into SQL records for in-depth data analysis. The project's core functionality relies on the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process.
      Features

# Approach 
    Harvest YouTube channel data using the YouTube API by providing a 'Channel ID'.
    Store channel data in MongoDB Atlas as documents.
    Convert MongoDB data into SQL records for data analysis.
    Use 11 different methods within the "YT2SQL" class to perform various tasks.
    Implement Streamlit to present code and data in a user-friendly UI.
    Execute data analysis using SQL queries and Python integration.

# Getting Started

    Install/Import the necessary modules: Streamlit, Pandas, PyMongo, Psycopg2, Googleapiclient, and Isodate.
    Ensure you have access to MongoDB Atlas and set up a PostgresSQL DBMS on your local environment.

# Technical Steps to Execute the Project

### Step 1: Install/Import Modules

    Ensure the required Python modules are installed: Streamlit, Pandas, PyMongo, Psycopg2, Googleapiclient, and Isodate.

### Step 2: Utilize the "YT2SQL" Class

    There are 11 methods within the class, each with specific functionality for data extraction and transformation. These methods cover tasks like data retrieval, data storage, and data analysis.

### Step 3: Run the Project with Streamlit

    Open the command prompt in the directory where "YtAPiproject.py" is located.
    Execute the command: streamlit run YtAPiproject.py. This will open a web browser, such as Google Chrome, displaying the project's user interface.

### Step 4: Configure Databases

    Ensure that you are connected to both MongoDB Atlas and your local PostgresSQL DBMS.
